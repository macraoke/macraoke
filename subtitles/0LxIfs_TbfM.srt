1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,620
Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,420
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?

3
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,860
You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it

4
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:37,480
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,240
Who needs to go to sleep, when I got you next to me?

6
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,340
All night I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you

7
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:55,460
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical

8
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:01,480
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice

9
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:08,620
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical

10
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:17,580
Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in

11
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:24,000
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?

12
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:34,360
I don't wanna live another life
Cuz this one's pretty nice
Living it up

13
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,900
Who needs to go to sleep, when I got you next to me?

14
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:44,180
All night I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you

15
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:51,280
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical

16
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,440
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice

17
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:04,160
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical

18
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,440
Hold on just a little tighter
Come on

19
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,160
Hold on, tell me if you're ready
Come on

20
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,320
Baby keep on dancing
Let's get physical

21
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,860
Hold on just a little tighter
Come on

22
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,420
Hold on, tell me if you're ready
Come on

23
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,240
Baby keep on dancing
Let's get physical

24
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:36,140
All night I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you

25
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,320
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical

26
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,400
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice

27
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:56,480
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical

28
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,020
(Physical, Physical)
Let's get physical
(Physical, Physical)

29
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,220
Let's get physical
(Physical, Physical)
Come on

30
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,000
Phy-phy-phy-physical
